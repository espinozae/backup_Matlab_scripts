# backup_MSc-Matlab_scripts
Matlab scripts for reference.

"Dicotomia.m", "Newton-Rapson.m", "Nelder-Mead.m" and "Steepest_Descent.m" scripts are here as a demo to show how I code and document my scripts solvinga a problem in Matlab.

"erick_main_CI_1" is a script that iterates simulations to my mechanical model with diffrent sets of initial conditions,
it determines if the sistems synchronize in-phase, anti-phase or if they stop oscillating. It builds a 2D graph to show the regions where certain results are expected.
