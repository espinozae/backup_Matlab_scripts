# some_backup_MSc-Matlab_scripts
Just to have something about my master of science scripts I did to analice my mechanical systems oscillators.

erick_main_CI_1 is a script that iterates simulations to my mechanical model (p_inv_sub_coupled.mdl) with diffrent sets of initial conditions,
it determines if the sistems sinchronice in-phase or anti-phase or they stop oscillating and builds a 2D graph to show the regions where certain results are expected
