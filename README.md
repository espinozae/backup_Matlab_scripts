# some_backup_MSc-Matlab_scripts
Just to have something about my master of science scripts I did to analyce my mechanical systems oscillators.

"erick_main_CI_1" is a script that iterates simulations to my mechanical model with diffrent sets of initial conditions,
it determines if the sistems sinchronice in-phase or anti-phase or if they stop oscillating. It builds a 2D graph to show the regions where certain results are expected.

"Tarea" named scripts contain code that you would expect from me solvinga a problem,
those cripts are optimization methods that are here as a demo to show how I code and document in Matlab.
